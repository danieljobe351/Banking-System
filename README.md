# Banking System

## 📌 Project Description  
This is a **Java-based Banking System** that allows users to perform various banking operations such as **creating accounts, checking balances, making deposits and withdrawals, and transferring funds**. The system is designed to simulate real-world banking functionalities with basic security and data management.

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Create new bank accounts (e.g., Savings, Checking)  
✔️ Deposit and withdraw money securely  
✔️ Transfer funds between accounts  
✔️ Check account balance  
✔️ Simple authentication system for users  
✔️ Data persistence using files or a database (depending on implementation)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **User Interface:** Java Swing (if applicable) or CLI (Command Line Interface)  
- **Data Storage:** File handling (TXT/CSV) or Database (MySQL, SQLite)  
- **OOP Concepts:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism  

## 📥 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/banking-system.git
   cd banking-system

	2.	Compile the Java files:

javac src/*.java


	3.	Run the application:

java src.Main


	4.	If using a database, ensure MySQL/SQLite is set up and configured properly.

📖 Usage Instructions

	1.	Launch the system and choose an option from the menu.
	2.	Create an account by entering user details.
	3.	Perform transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
	4.	View account details and balances.
	5.	Exit the system when done.

🔮 Future Enhancements

	•	Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX
	•	Add encryption for secure data storage
	•	Introduce multi-user authentication with roles (Admin, Customer, etc.)
	•	Implement transaction history tracking
